1) What is the difference between a byte stream and a character stream?
    byte streams handle i/o of bytes, character streams handle i/o of characters (character stream takes in a byte stream)

2) List at least 3 examples of byte stream classes?
    InputStream

3) List at least 3 examples of character stream classes?
    InputReader

4) What is try-with-resources? Why is it super cool?
    open and close a file in the initial statement (no need for finally block, no need to remember to close a file)

5) Demonstrate a try-wth-resources block:
    try (FileInputStream f = new FileInputStream("sourcepath.txt");
        FileOutputStream fo = new FileOutputStream ("destinationpath.txt")) {}

6) What does the read() method on the FileInputStream class return?
    int

7) What is the documentation above of the FileInputStream class header say? (hint: inside /** ... */)
    **down click to read the source code information

8) Is a DataOutputStream used for bytes or characters?
    bytes

9) What is a BufferedReader?
    translates to human readable characters

10) Why does a BufferedReader require an InputStreamReader as an argument?
    InputStreamReader reads character by character and then BufferedReader translates those characters into lines

11) What does the InputStreamReader do with its byte stream argument?
    converts the bytes to characters

12) What is the difference between the read() and readLine() on BufferedReader?
    read() returns int and readLine() returns String
    read() reads word by word, readLine() reads line by line

13) Demonstrate instantiating a BufferedReader that will read a file called "yucatan_cenotes.txt"

FileInputStream fis = new FileInputStream("somepath.txt");
FileOutputStream fout = new FileOutputStream("someotherpath.txt");
-or-
BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader (new FileReader(new FileInputStream("takes_a_path.txt")));
